#### Build and Run

- Download primesieve source code [here](http://primesieve.org/downloads/).
- Compile primesieve with proper architecture [iOS autoconf file](https://github.com/intlres1/iOS-autoconf).
- Add compiled libprimesieve.a to project's Link Binary list (remove original one if exists).
- Check and confirm that libstdc++.dylib is already in that list.
- Build and run.

#### Hacking

- Add more tabs for more pratices.
- Hack it freely.
